# Portfolio Creation Using Momentum Strategy

## Introduction

The goal of this assignment was to create a portfolio consisting of multiple financial instruments and evaluate its performance using a trading strategy (momentum strategy) developed in a previous project.

#### Requirements:

Running the same strategy on multiple assets
Optimizing the parameters for each asset
Combining the strategies into a diversified portfolio
Plotting the combined performance
Calculating correlation between strategies

## Data and Instruments

- AAPL — Apple Inc.
- AMZN — Amazon.com, Inc.
- MSFT — Microsoft Corporation
- TSLA — Tesla, Inc.
- GOOGL — Alphabet Inc.
- BP — BP p.l.c.
- GLD — SPDR Gold Shares ETF (Gold)
- SPOT — Spotify Technology S.A.
- BKNG — Booking Holdings Inc.
- META — Meta Platforms

Historical price data was downloaded using Yahoo Finance (via yfinance library).

## Strategy Description (Momentum Strategy)

I reused the momentum strategy created in Homework 3:
Momentum = Close - Close.shift(n)

If Momentum > 0 → Signal = +1 (long)
If Momentum < 0 → Signal = -1 (short)

Daily Profit = Previous Signal × Daily Price Change – Trading Costs

#### The output of the strategy includes:

Daily returns
Daily profit
Equity curve


## Parameter Optimization

Each instrument can behave differently.
To find the best momentum window n, I used brute force optimization:
Tested multiple values and selected the parameters with the highest Sharpe ratio

Saved the best strategy results for each asset
Example output:
AAPL: best n = 20
AMZN: best n = 10
MSFT: best n = 30

This step ensures the strategy is tuned for each financial instrument.

## Portfolio Construction

- An equal-weight portfolio using percentage returns:
- portfolio_returns = mean of all strategy returns (each day)
- portfolio_equity = cumulative product of (1 + portfolio_returns)

- This method:
- Allocates equal capital to each strategy
- Represents real portfolio behavior
- Produces fair and comparable performance
- This is the correct way to combine strategies.

## Correlation Analysis

I calculated the correlation matrix of daily strategy returns.
This shows how similarly or differently strategies behave:
Most correlations were low (–0.10 to +0.30) - this means good diversification.

Momentum strategies across different assets often have low correlation
The portfolio benefits from mixing independent strategies
Correlation was visualized using a heatmap.

Correlation as "how similarly two strategies move."
1.0 → move exactly the same
0.0 → no relationship
–1.0 → move opposite

## Visualizations

The following charts were generated:
Individual price charts for all 10 assets
Bad portfolio total equity (incorrect)
Good portfolio equity (correct)
Correlation matrix heatmap
Equity curves of individual strategies vs portfolio
These help illustrate diversification, performance differences, and why equal-weighting matters.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates:
Reuse of a strategy from previous work
Ability to optimize strategy parameters
Portfolio construction skills
Understanding of correct vs. incorrect methods
Interpretation of correlations
Visualization of results
The equal-weight momentum portfolio shows smoother growth and less risk compared to individual strategies, thanks to low correlation and diversified exposure.

#### Short:

- Apply the same strategy (momentum) to many assets
- Optimized to find the best n for each instrument
- Combine the strategy results (returns) into a portfolio
